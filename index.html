    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joshua Schladt, and I am a Software Engineering major. I am studying so that I can work in web and software development (specifically mobile apps) in the future. Technology in general is something I find myself very interested in, and I love to research info on new phones and laptops.</p>

    <div>
        <p>I went to High School at Newsome High School in Litha, Florida (Tampa area). In my free time, I like to play the viola, listen to music (I mostly like classic rock, but I am willing to listen to any genre provided the song is good), and watch movies, and some specific favorite movies of mine are Blade Runner 2049 and La La Land. In general, I consider myself to be quiet, yet friendly and approachable person, and am willing to interact and socialize with people when needed.</p>
