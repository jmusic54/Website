    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Calculus 3</li>

    <h2>Experience in the following Languages</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <p>I took a class that taught these three languages. I would say my experience with these languages are relatively the same, with me having slightly more confidence in HTML and CSS than Javascript. In the future I am looking to improve my Javascript knowledge, as my experience with it is mostly in terms of web develeopment.</p>
        <li>Java</li>
        <p>I took a class that focused on this language on a beginner level, and will be taking a class in the future that focuses on more advanced programming concepts that will be using this language. I will also be taking the Java certification exam as well in January 2019. I feel pretty good about my Java knowledge, at least on a beginner level.</p>
        <li>Python</li>
        <p>I have only recently begun learning this language, but I have done some exercises using the languages, and am striving to be able to learn even more and develop projects using the language.</p>
